# CSC 303 Platformer (Spring 2018)

This is a game made for Missouri State University's *CSC 303 - Introductory Video Game Development for Designers and 
Programmers*. Various lessons and homework assignments will be structured around adding or improving the game's 
features, allowing a guided experience through developing your first game.

The game is programmed in [Haxe](www.haxe.org) and uses the framework/game engine [HaxeFlixel](www.haxeflixel.com).
